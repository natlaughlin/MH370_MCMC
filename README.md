Feel free to reach out with comments or suggestions -- especially critiques and criticisms.

I've noticed several typos in the IPython notebook; I plan on addressing in an updated version (separate notebook).

Updates 3/27 (natlaughlin):

mh370.py is the standalone python script version of the above work by Conor L. Myhrvold (myhrvold).  

To run it, you will need to unzip runways.txt.zip to the same directory as the script.

It outputs the plots to SVG instead of displaying them, and it looks for "runways.txt" in the same directory as the script, but otherwise everything is the same.
